                                        Before I started dating my boyfriend, I was never really a youtube kind of girl. I tried– especially in later middle school when it was really just taking off–but I just never really got into discovering content or watching vlogs.
<br>
Before he started dating me, half an episode of Big Bang Theory was enough television for him. Shows weren’t really his thing – he just couldn’t get into them. 
<br>
So, in the beauty of compromise, now I love youtube food vlogs and he can binge-watch an entire series in one weekend. 
<br>
Love is so beautiful.
<br>
Anyway, now, one of my most favorite pastimes is watching youtube food vlogs where the person filming tries one kind of food from multiple places and compares them. Well, actually, my most favorite pastime is watching that video and saying, “We could do that. We really, really could.”  Then we pick a food that we want to try and spend the rest of the day walking through the city eating as much as we can. Unfortunately, eating as much as we can usually means only making it to one or two stops before we are too full to keep going. Which is why we actually can’t do one of those videos; we really, really can’t. 
<br>
But, even though it took us multiple weekends of trying to eat like these food vloggers, we now have enough to try writing like a food vlogger – at least when it comes to grilled cheese.
<br>
Grilled cheese is maybe the coziest food that can be eaten in these Boston winters, especially when the bread is perfectly toasted and the cheese is perfectly melty. That’s probably why, on these chilly winter afternoons, we find ourselves saying “I’m not starving, but wanna split a grilled cheese?” That also explains why the answer to that question is almost always “Yup, let’s go to Flour.”
<br>
Flour - Flour is probably one of Boston’s best-known bakeries and I'm sure it’s a surprise to no one when I say that the grilled cheese from Flour is our number one, go-to, shoot-it’s-closed-we-will-go-somewhere-else kind of sandwich. The bread is always perfectly toasted. The cheese is always perfectly melty. It’s not squished. It’s a little bit crunchy. And it hits the spot every.single.time.
<br>
Thinking Cup - While the Thinking Cup is our favorite spot for a warm-your-soul kind of latte, it’s second on our list of grilled cheese spots in Boston. Part of the joy of eating a grilled cheese is that it’s a no-fuss kind of food. The thing about the Thinking Cup is that when you order it, it’s not no fuss. You have to pick your bread, your cheese and your sauce. And, here’s where I get frustrated, they all sound yummy! So, instead of walking in, ordering a grilled cheese and getting a delicious sandwich and enjoying it in contentment, I’m walking in, ordering a delicious sandwich and then walking away dreaming of all of the other combinations (anything with the roasted garlic aioli) I could have made. Thus, not fully satisfying the grilled-cheese craving that brought me there in the first place. <br>

LoLa Burger - If we are in the mood for something a little more exciting than an average joe grilled cheese but too hungry to make all the choices associated with build-your-own grilled cheese, we go to Lola Burger. Not only is their grilled cheese a perfectly buttery, little bit crispy, melty cheese, cut diagonally (so much more delicious) sandwich but it also comes with a creamy bowl of tomato soup. Whether we order it for our meal or just as an appetizer (more likely), it never fails to warm us, fill us and satisfy that cozy craving. 
<br>
Tatte- The last grilled cheese on our list is the one from Tatte. The main reason it’s last on our list is because we never really choose to go to Tatte for the grilled cheese. Most often, we go because we want a biscuit sandwich but splitting a biscuit sandwich isn’t quite filling enough, so, we get the grilled cheese too! It’s a good grilled cheese--a little crunchier than the others but, if you get it with avocado, the combination of the crunchy bread with the creamy avocado is one you will not regret. 
<br>
After writing this blog, I’ve realized that another reason that we can’t be food vloggers is because we are pretty easy to please–especially when it comes to grilled cheese. But, critics or not, we wanted to share our cheesy treasure with you so that you might also fulfill those cozy, buttery, melty cravings that come around this time of year. :) <br>
